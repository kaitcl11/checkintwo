<heading> Summary of "The Garden of Forking Paths" </heading>
<p> Jorge Luis Borges's story focuses on the character Yu Tsun, a spy for the Axis powers during World War Two. The story kicks off with the reader learning Tsun has just discovered that a man he has worked with named Runeberg has been killed. This sets the story into motion as Tsun realizes he is in danger and realizes he must signal the name of the next bombing target to the Axis powers. Therefore, he realizes he needs to get out into the countryside to send the message.

<p> After a train ride of anxiety, in which Tsun believed he was being followed by the antagonist Madden, he is told which direction to go and is led to a home that is familiar. He finds a man within the home named  Stephen Albert who is a Sinologist and just happens to have a piece of work written by the narrator’s ancestor. As they discuss the story and the complex idea behind it, the reader gets lost in the meaning of this multidimensional world that’s been built by his ancestor. Meanwhile, Tsun has the sensation of multiple people in the garden with them—other versions of themselves, or Madden? As Tsun and Albert discuss the work, Madden arrives at the secluded spot, and Tsun shoots Albert dead. He is then arrested by Madden and it is revealed that he is to be hung. However, Tsun accomplished what he wanted by killing Albert, as Albert was the name of the city to be bombed. It seems the narrator dies with satisfaction towards his fate—and the path he chose. </p>
