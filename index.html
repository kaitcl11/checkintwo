<heading> Summary of "The Garden of Forking Paths" </heading>
<p> "The Garden of Forking Paths" is a short story by Jorge Luis Borges that was published in 1941. It's a fairly long read for a short story as it is more complex than some, but I wouldn't want anyone to miss this creative tale about the character Yu Tsun.
